# Kanji-Flashcards-Android-App
Using Java, I made an Android app for studying Japanese Kanji symbols. The app uses a SQLite database to store all of the Kanji, and an API to download the definitions of each Kanji in JSON format. There is a lot of different options for the user to choose from, including a quiz feature. You can download the project here, or download the apk here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16-VifeyPOvgsuHCP4jj3kQLB5sn7YIQ4?usp=drive_link
