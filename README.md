# Kanji-Flashcards-Android-App
Using Java, I made an Android app for studying Japanese Kanji symbols. The app uses a SQLite database to store all of the Kanji, and an API to download the definitions of each Kanji in JSON format. There is a lot of different options for the user to choose from, including a quiz feature. You can download the project here, or download the app itself on the google play store here:  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.niu.students.z1836771.kanjiflashcards
